# Future plans (scrappy)

Bullet list of features we want to implement later. No order implied; refine and prioritize as we go.

## Homepage

- **Recently searched** — Horizontal section on homepage showing last N searches (we store 10 in localStorage; see Phase 3.5 in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_SEARCH_SPEED_AND_STREAM.md`). Each item links to `/results?{params}`. For now we only capture the data.
- **Recently viewed hotels** — Horizontal section on homepage showing last N hotels viewed (we store 10 by hotelId in localStorage). Each item links to hotel detail. For now we only capture the data.
